    <h2> We will show you the caption for a photo. We will not show you the photo. Using only the caption and what you know about the world:
      • Write one alternate caption that is definitely a true description of the photo. Example: For the caption “Two dogs are running through a field.” you could write “There are animals outdoors.”
      • Write one alternate caption that might be a true description of the photo. Example: For the caption “Two dogs are running through a field.” you could write “Some puppies are running to catch a stick.”
      • Write one alternate caption that is definitely a false description of the photo. Example: For the caption “Two dogs are running through a field.” you could write “The pets are sitting on a couch.” This is different from the maybe correct category because it’s impossible for the dogs to be both running and sitting.</h2>
